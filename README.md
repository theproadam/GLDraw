# GLDraw
A light-weight wrapper designed to ease OpenGL development with C# 

**Currentely unusable in its current state**, as many changes are expected to be made in order to be as similar to XFDraw. The goal is to create two identical rendering API's that have fully interchangable code.

There is no use of any external libraries (ie. GLAD, GLEW, GLFW). Everything from blitting, function loading, shader compilation, etc is done manually by the library.
